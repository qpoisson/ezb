This sample code is provided to import a binary EZ-Mesh file.  This is a simple graphics file format created by John W. Ratcliff which supports both binary and XML formats.

EZ-Mesh is able to represent meshes, sub-meshes, materials, skeletons, and animation data (key-framed) without any fuss or muss.  The vertex formats are able to express a wide array of intepolants.

The code to read a binary mesh file with all of this data is in a single .CPP file.
